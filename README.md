APIMs is Automated Precise Image Measuring software for the analysis of SEM images. This software was written to automate the dimensional analysis of nanowires of different geometries.

This code was originally written in MATLAB and as such requires MATLAB to run. A standalone (.exe compiled version) is available upon request.
The code includes a graphical user interface (GUI). To run the code, download all files in MATLAB Code and paste them in the same folder. Then run the file "APIMs_V6_GUI.mlapp".

An additional description of how to use and how it works will be made available later. Please keep an eye on https://github.com/mcpim/APIMs/ for the latest version.
